# WINTER WORKSHOP

In this practice tutorial, we will learn how to implement some key machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

Our programming environment is `Python 3` with `Jupyter Notebook` and common open source libraries.

**Tip:** To have all the dependencies with the good versions needed for this project, a good practice is to set up a virtual environnment. Check [set_up_venv.md](https://github.com/segobrivet/WINTER_WORKSHOP_STARaCom/blob/master/set_up_venv.md) file.

Please, have installed the following packages:  
```
pip install <package_name>
```
OR
```
python -m pip install <package_name>
```

- numpy
- tensorflow (make sure you are using version 2.x)
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image  

This project is split in 3 exercises:
- Create a 1-layer neural network and do binary classification over data points  <br>
[1. simple_NN.ipynb](https://github.com/segobrivet/WINTER_WORKSHOP_STARaCom/blob/master/1.%20simple_NN.ipynb)
- Create a convolutional neural network and do multi-label classification over images  <br>
[2. Digit_classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/segobrivet/WINTER_WORKSHOP_STARaCom/blob/master/2.%20Digit_classifier.ipynb)
- Implement logistic regression algorithm from scratch <br>
[3. Logistic_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/segobrivet/WINTER_WORKSHOP_STARaCom/blob/master/3.%20Logistic_regression.ipynb)
